# Runic Consulting — Facility Systems Playbook

**Purpose:** This repository is the source of truth for *The Runic Consulting Facility-to-Systems Playbook*—a practical operating system for turning a sports training facility (and partner performance programs) into a repeatable, scalable, membership-driven business **without losing the culture**.

This playbook is written for:
- Facility owners (baseball/softball, multi-sport, performance)
- Private coaches who want predictable income and clean operations
- Operators installing SOPs, dashboards, and offer systems

## What’s inside
- `/manuscript` — book chapters (copy/paste into KDP/print workflows)
- `/templates` — SOPs, scripts, dashboards, offer templates (deployable)
- `/case-studies` — notes and maps for GBC / Carolina Acceleration style ecosystems
- `/references` — glossary + web/source log

## How to use (recommended)
1. Read `manuscript/00-front-matter.md` (rules + definitions)
2. Implement in this order:
   - **Packaging** (offers) → **Operations** (SOPs) → **Growth** (flywheel) → **Runic Method** (audit/install)
3. Copy/paste tools from `/templates` as you build.
